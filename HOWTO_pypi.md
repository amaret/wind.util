* edit `setup.py` and change version
* `python setup.py sdist`
* `python setup.py register -r pypi`

* then find the files for this release on pypi and upload (I have an auth issue or could use the upload command)

### if you are developing and want to install a version editable from the clone of the repo:

* `pip install -e .`
